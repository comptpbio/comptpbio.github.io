I am Systems Engineer who happens to like Biology and Economics. I have created this website as a way to share the code I write in R and in Python to do fun things such as web scrapping, data wrangling, data visualisation and most import for data analytics.

Since I'm doing science, I also use this web to share my stories about what is like to do science.
